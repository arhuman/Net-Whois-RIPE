=head1 NAME

Net::Whois::Object::Mntner::AFRINIC - an object representation of the RPSL Mntner block

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects in the RIPE Database may be protected using Mntner (pronounced
"maintainer") objects.  A Mntner object specifies authentication
information required to authorise creation, deletion or modification
of the objects protected by the Mntner.

Objects are protected by a Mntner, if they contain a reference to the Mntner
in the object. This is done by including a mnt-by attribute. Other
attributes offer hierarchical protection. The mnt-by attribute is mandatory
in all object types. Most users set the mnt-by value in a Mntner to
reference itself.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 B<new( %options )>

Constructor for the Net::Whois::Object::Mntner::AFRINIC class

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $class, @options ) = @_;

    my $self = bless {}, $class;
    $self->_init(@options);

    return $self;
}

=head2 B<mntner( [$mntner] )>

Accessor to the mntner attribute.
Accepts an optional mntner value to be added to the mntner array,
always return the current mntner.

The unique name of a mntner object. APNIC recommends the following formats:

Maintainer for resource registrations:

<maint>-<iso3166-code>-<organization>

 EXAMPLE 
 MAINT-WF-SPARKYNET

=head2 B<descr( [$descr] )>

Accessor to the descr attribute.
Accepts an optional descr line to be added to the descr array,
always return the current descr array.

associated with it.

=head2 B<org( [$org] )>

Accessor to the org attribute.
Accepts an optional org value to be added to the org array,
always return the current org array.

The organisation this object is bound to.

=head2 B<admin_c( [$contact] )>

Accessor to the admin_c attribute.
Accepts an optional contact to be added to the admin_c array,
always return the current admin_c array.

The NIC-handle of an on-site contact Person object. As more than one
person often fulfills a role function, there may be more than one admin_c
listed.

An administrative contact (admin_c) must be someone who is
physically located at the site of the network.

=head2 B<tech_c( [$contact] )>

Accessor to the tech_c attribute.
Accepts an optional contact to be added to the tech_c array,
always return the current tech_c array.

The NIC-handle of a technical contact Person or Role object.  As more than
one person often fulfills a role function, there may be more than one tech_c
listed.

A technical contact (tech_c) must be a person responsible for the
day-to-day operation of the network, but does not need to be
physically located at the site of the network.

=head2 B<upd_to( [$upd_to] )>

Accessor to the upd_to attribute.
Accepts an optional upd_to value to be added to the upd_to array,
always return the current upd_to array.

The upd_to attribute specifies the email address to be notified when an
attempt to update an object protected by this Mntner is unsuccessful.

=head2 B<mnt_nfy( [$mnt_nfy] )>

Accessor to the mnt_nfy attribute.
Accepts an optional mnt_nfy value to be added to the mnt_nfy array,
always return the current mnt_nfy array.

The mnt_nfy attribute specifies the email address to be notified when an
object protected by this Mntner is successfully updated.

=head2 B<auth( [$auth] )>

Accessor to the auth attribute.
Accepts an optional auth value to be added to the auth array,
always return the current auth array.

The auth attribute defines an authentication scheme to be used. . Any of

Accessor to the mnt_by attribute.
Accepts an optional mnt_by value to be added to the mnt_by array,
always return the current mnt_by array.

Lists a registered Mntner used to authorize and authenticate changes to

Most users set the mnt-by value in a Mntner to reference itself.

=head2 B<auth_override( [$auth_override] )>

Accessor to the auth_override attribute.
Accepts an optional auth_override, always return the current auth_override.

Routing Policy System Security specification defines an auth_override attribute
in the Mntner object template. Together with referral-by attribute, they allow 
for a Mntner to be modified if it becomes unresponsive. 
As this is not part of the core functionality of the RIPE Database, 
it has not been implemented in the current version of the database.

=head2 B<referral_by( [$referral_by] )>

Accessor to the referral_by attribute.
Accepts an optional referral_by, always return the current referral_by.
