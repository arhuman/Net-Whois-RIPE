=head1 NAME

Net::Whois::Object::AutNum - an object representation of a RPSL AutNum block

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Autonomous System numbers ('aut-num' objects) are globally unique identifiers
for Autonomous Systems.

The aut-num object specifies routing policies. It refers to a group of IP
networks that have a single and clearly defined external routing policy,
operated by one or more network operators â€“ an Autonomous System (AS).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new ( %options )

Constructor for the Net::Whois::Object::AutNum class

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $class, %options ) = @_;

    my $self = bless {}, $class;

    for my $key ( keys %options ) {
        $self->$key( $options{$key} );
    }

    return $self;
}

=head2 B<aut_num( [$aut_num] )>

Accessor to the aut_num attribute.
Accepts an optional aut_num, always return the current aut_num array.

The value of the aut_num attribute is the AS Number of the Autonomous
System that this object describes and takes the form of ASn where n is 
a 32 bit number..

Leading zeroes (AS0352) are not allowed and will be removed (AS352) by the
database software.

=cut

sub aut_num {
    my ( $self, $aut_num ) = @_;

    if ( $aut_num and $aut_num !~ /^AS\d+/ ) {
        warn "Illegal aut-num ($aut_num) : should be ASn, n being a 32 bit
        number with no leading 0";
    }

    $self->{aut_num} = $aut_num if defined $aut_num;
    return $self->{aut_num};
}

=head2 B<as_name( [$as_name] )>

Accessor to the as_name attribute.
Accepts an optional as_name, always return the current as_name array.

The as-name attribute is a symbolic name of the AS.

=cut

sub as_name {
    my ( $self, $as_name ) = @_;
    $self->{as_name} = $as_name if defined $as_name;
    return $self->{as_name};
}

=head2 B<descr( [$descr] )>

Accessor to the descr attribute.
Accepts an optional descr value to be added to the descr array, always return the current descr array.

=cut

sub descr {
    my ( $self, $descr ) = @_;
    push @{ $self->{descr} }, $descr if defined $descr;
    return \@{ $self->{descr} };
}

=head2 B<member_of( [$mbr_of] )>

Accessor to the member_of attribute.
Accepts an optional member_of value to be added to the member_of array,
always return the current member_of array.

The member_of attribute value identifies a set object that this object
wants to be a member of. This claim, however, should be acknowledged by a
respective mbrs_by_ref attribute in the referenced object.

An aut-num may be useful to include in an 'as-set' if your network maintains a
number of Autonomous Systems or wishes to include its routes in an upstream
provider's routing information.

To be included in an 'as-set', the 'as-set' object must:
include the keyword "ANY" or the AS number's mbrs_by_ref attribute
and/or list the AS number in the members attribute

=cut

sub member_of {
    my ( $self, $member_of ) = @_;
