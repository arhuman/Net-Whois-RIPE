=head1 NAME

Net::Whois::Object::InetNum - an object representation of a RPSL InetNum block

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An inetnum object contains information on allocations and assignments
of IPv4 address space.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new ( @options )

Constructor for the Net::Whois::Object::InetNum class

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $class, @options ) = @_;

    my $self = bless {}, $class;

    $self->_init(@options);

    return $self;
}

Accessor to the admin_c attribute.
Accepts an optional contact to be added to the admin_c array,
always return the current admin_c array.

The NIC-handle of an on-site contact Person object. As more than one person
often fulfills a role function, there may be more than one admin_c listed.

An administrative contact (admin_c) must be someone who is physically
located at the site of the network.

=head2 B<tech_c( [$contact] )>

Accessor to the tech_c attribute.
Accepts an optional contact to be added to the tech_c array,
always return the current tech_c array.

The NIC-handle of a technical contact Person or Role object.  As more than
one person often fulfills a role function, there may be more than one tech_c
listed.

day-to-day operation of the network, but does not need to be
physically located at the site of the network.

=head2 B<status( [$status] )>

Accessor to the 'status' attribute.
Accepts an optional status, always return the current status.

The status attribute indicates where the address range represented by an
inetnum object sits in a hierarchy and how it is used.

Status can have one of these values:

=over 4

=item ALLOCATED UNSPECIFIED

=item ALLOCATED PA

=item ALLOCATED PI

=item LIR-PARTITIONED PA

=item LIR-PARTITIONED PI

=item SUB-ALLOCATED PA

=item ASSIGNED PA
