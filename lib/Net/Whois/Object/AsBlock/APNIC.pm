=head1 NAME

Net::Whois::Object::AsBlock::APNIC - an object representation of the RPSL AsBlock block

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An as-block object is needed to delegate a range of AS numbers to a
given repository.  This object may be used for authorisation of the
creation of aut-num objects within the range specified by the
"as-block:" attribute.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 B<new( %options )>

Constructor for the Net::Whois::Object::AsBlock::APNIC class

    return $self;
}

Information on individual AS numbers within an as-block object are
stored in the appropriate Internet Registry's Whois Database.

=head2 B<descr( [$descr] )>

Accessor to the descr attribute.

Accepts an optional remarks to be added to the remarks array,
always return the current remarks array.

Information on the registry that maintains details of AS numbers assigned from

the AS numbers.

=head2 B<tech_c( [$tech_c] )>

Accessor to the tech_c attribute.
Accepts an optional tech_c to be added to the tech_c array,
always return the current tech_c array.

one person often fulfills a role function, there may be more than one tech-c
listed.

A technical contact (tech-c) must be a person responsible for the
day-to-day operation of the network, but does not need to be
physically located at the site of the network.


=head2 B<admin_c( [$admin_c])>

Accessor to the admin_c attribute.
Accepts an optional admin_c to be added to the admin_c array,

An administrative contact(admin-c) must be someone who is physically
located at the site of the network.

=head2 B<notify( [$notify] )>

Accessor to the notify attribute.
Accepts an optional value to be added notify array,

Accessor to the mnt_by attribute.
Accepts an optional mnt_by value to be added to the mnt_by array,

Accessor to the changed attribute.
Accepts an optional changed value to be added to the changed array,
