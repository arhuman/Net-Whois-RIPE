Net::Whois::RIPE

A pure-perl programming interface to the RIPE Database Whois service.

This is an evolution of the module I inherited from Luis Motta Campos.
Which was a complete rewrite of the old version of the module inherited from
Paul Gampe. It incorporated new concepts Luis have learned while working at the
RIPE NCC between Nov 2007 and Jan 2010. 

I've strived to maintain backward compatibility while providing a modern perl
implementation featuring all the currently available features of a RIPE
Database client.

For more information about the RIPE Database, please refer to the RIPE NCC
website at http://www.ripe.net/whois
