Net::Whois::RIPE

A pure-perl programming interface to the RIPE Database Whois service.

This is a complete rewrite of the old version of the module I inherited from
Paul Gampe. It incorporates new concepts I've learned while I worked at the
RIPE NCC between Nov 2007 and Jan 2010. 

I've strived to maintain backward compatibility while providing a modern perl
implementation featuring all the currently available features of a RIPE
Database client.

For more information about the RIPE Database, please refer to the RIPE NCC
website at http://www.ripe.net/whois
